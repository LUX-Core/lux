 *
 * 2) cache is a cache which is performant in memory usage and lookup speed. It
 * is lockfree for erase operations. Elements are lazily erased on the next

 * flags for memory efficiency.
 *

 * ensure that writes and reads are properly synchronized.
 *
 * On setup(n), all bits up to n are marked as collected.
