Luxcore version 4.0.0 is now available from:

  <https://github.com/LUX-Core/lux/releases>

This is a new minor-revision version release, including various bug fixes and
performance improvements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:

  <https://github.com/LUX-Core/lux/issues>

Recommended Update
==============

Luxcore v4.0.0 is a recommended, semi-mandatory update for all users. This release contains transaction creation bug fixes for zLUX spends, automint calculation adjustments, and other various updates/fixes.

zLUX spending requires this update.

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/LUX-Qt (on Mac) or luxd/lux-qt (on Linux).

Compatibility
==============

Luxcore is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support),
No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you
can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues.
Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

Luxcore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.

### :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation: MacOS 10.13 High Sierra :exclamation::exclamation::exclamation:

**Currently there are issues with the 3.0.x gitian releases on MacOS version 10.13 (High Sierra), no reports of issues on older versions of MacOS.**


Notable Changes
===============

Auto Wallet Backup
---------------------
In addition to the automatic wallet backup that is done at each start of the client, a new automatic backup function has been added that will, by default, create a backup of the wallet file during each zLUX mint operation (zLUX spends which re-mint their change are also included in this). This functionality is controlled by the `-backupzlux` command-line option, which defaults to `1` (enabled, auto-backup).

Users that wish to prevent this behavior (not recommended) can pass `-backupzlux=0` at the command-line when starting the client, or add `backupzlux=0` to their `lux.conf` file.

zLUX Automint Calculations
---------------------
A bug in the automint calculations was made apparent on mainnet when block times exceeded expectations, resulting in zLUX mint transactions that were in an unconfirmed state to still be treated as if they had never been minted. This caused automint to effectively mint more than what was intended.

zLUX Spending Fix
---------------------
The size of zLUX spend transactions is knowingly larger than normal transactions, and while this was expected, a much stricter check against the scriptsig size is used for mainnet, causing the transactions to be rejected by the mempool, and thus not being packaged into any blocks.

zLUX Transaction Recovery
---------------------
Due to the aforementioned issue with zLUX spending, users may find that their attempted spends are now conflicted and zLUX balances are not represented as expected. "Recovery" of these transactions can be done using the following methods:

1. GUI:

   The Privacy tab has the `Reset` and `Rescan` buttons that can be used to restore these mints/spends from a state of being marked as unavailable.

2. RPC:

   The RPC commands `resetspentzerocoin` and `resetmintzerocoin` are the command-line counterparts to the above, and can be used by users that do not use the GUI wallet.

RPC Changes
---------------------
The `bip38decrypt` command has had it's parameter order changed to be more consistent with it's counterpart. The command now expects the LUX address as it's first parameter and the passphrase as it's second parameter.

Bip38 Compatibility With 3rd Party Tools
---------------------
The in-wallet bip38 encryption method was leaving the final 4 bytes of the encrypted key blank. This caused an incompatibility issue with 3rd party tools like the paper wallet generators that could decrypt bip38 encrypted keys. Cross-tool compatibility has now been restored.
