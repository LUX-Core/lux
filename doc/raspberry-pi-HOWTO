Head over to https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/ and download the LITE version. As of writing this, it is 
RASPBIAN STRETCH LITE. Extract the file with .img extension only from the compressed archieve.
Download the microSD card burner from https://etcher.io
Insert your microSD card reader/writer and burn the .img file on your microSD card.
After a successful burn & eject , remove the microSD card from the writer and insert it into Raspberry Pi and hook it up with a 
HDMI Monitor or a TV. For video demonstration, just watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJDIgS8nres

Default login is "pi" and password is "raspberry"
Run raspi-config and enable ssh access on your Pi first. ( you have to use sudo there )
Read: http://www.instructables.com/id/Use-ssh-to-talk-with-your-Raspberry-Pi/
Find out the IP address of your Pi by logging into your home DSL/Fiber device. It will show as "pi".

From now on, just paste the following commands to your raspberry

sudo passwd (set up sudo access. its self explanatory)
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev libdb++-dev libdb-dev libboost-all-dev libqrencode-dev libminiupnpc-dev nano git
sudo git clone https://github.com/bhcoind/source.git
cd source/src/leveldb/
sudo chmod +x build_detect_platform
sudo make libleveldb.a libmemenv.a
cd .. .. ( its two times .. with a space )
sudo make -f makefile.unix -j2 ( this will build the wallet / daemon for your Pi. Patience there ...)
sudo strip bhcoind
sudo mv bhcoind /usr/bin
bhcoind ( run it once and wait for it to give you a config missing error )
cd ( enter )
cd .bhcoind ( enter )
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bhcoind/releases/master/bhcoin.conf ( enter )
cd ( enter )
bhcoind ( enter )

^ this runs the wallet or the daemon. You can check the sync progress by issuing:

tail -f .bhcoind/debug.log ( press Ctrl+C to cancel )

Get a wallet address

bhcoind getnewaddress ( enter )

Copy that address and send 1 BHC as a test. Wait for a block confirmation and it should show up after you do a :

bhcoind getbalance ( enter )

To enable staking on your Pi device, edit bhcoin.conf file located in .bhcoin folder.

sudo nano .bhcoin/bhcoin.conf ( enter )

add line "staking=1" ( Press Ctrl + X to exit while saving "

bhcoind stop (enter)
bhcoind (enter)
bhcoind getinfo ( enter )

Make sure it says "staking: true:

If you wish to take backup of your staking wallet or copy over your current desktop wallet, use WinSCP or Filezilla client.
Be sure to specy IP, user and password in the file transfer client. Protocol should be SCP and port 22. For Filezilla,
user the following :

host: sftp://pi-ipaddress user: pi password:your-password port:22

Jump to .bhcoin folder and copy the wallet.dat or place your wallet backup there in that folder. ( Important: Make sure 
bhcoind stop) is done before you do this.

Thats pretty much it. Ask me for tips on Discord or Telegram on how to stake BHC on your PI.
