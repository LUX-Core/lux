Luxcore version *version* is now available from:

  <https://github.com/LUX-Core/lux/releases>

This is a new major version release, including various bug fixes and
performance improvements, as well as updated translations.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:

  <https://github.com/LUX-Core/lux/issues>

Mandatory Update
==============

Luxcore v3.0.0 is a mandatory update for all users. This release contains new consensus rules and improvements that are not backwards compatible with older versions. Users will have a grace period of one week to update their clients before enforcement of this update is enabled.

Users updating from a previous version after the 16th of October will require a full resync of their local blockchain from either the P2P network or by way of the bootstrap.

How to Upgrade
==============

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely shut down (which might take a few minutes for older versions), then run the installer (on Windows) or just copy over /Applications/LUX-Qt (on Mac) or luxd/lux-qt (on Linux).

Compatibility
==============

Luxcore is extensively tested on multiple operating systems using
the Linux kernel, macOS 10.8+, and Windows Vista and later.

Microsoft ended support for Windows XP on [April 8th, 2014](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/WindowsForBusiness/end-of-xp-support),
No attempt is made to prevent installing or running the software on Windows XP, you
can still do so at your own risk but be aware that there are known instabilities and issues.
Please do not report issues about Windows XP to the issue tracker.

Luxcore should also work on most other Unix-like systems but is not
frequently tested on them.

Notable Changes
===============

Zerocoin (zLUX) Protocol
---------------------

At long last, the zLUX release is here and the zerocoin protocol has been fully implemented! This allows users to send transactions with 100% fungible coins and absolutely zero history or link-ability to their previous owners.

Full and comprehensive details about the process and the use will be posted here during the days between Oct 6 and Oct 13.

Tor Service Integration Improvements
---------------------

Integrating with Tor is now easier than ever! Starting with Tor version 0.2.7.1 it is possible, through Tor's control socket API, to create and destroy 'ephemeral' hidden services programmatically. Luxcore has been updated to make use of this.

This means that if Tor is running (and proper authorization is available), Luxcore automatically creates a hidden service to listen on, without manual configuration. Luxcore will also use Tor automatically to connect to other .onion nodes if the control socket can be successfully opened. This will positively affect the number of available .onion nodes and their usage.

This new feature is enabled by default if Luxcore is listening, and a connection to Tor can be made. It can be configured with the `-listenonion`, `-torcontrol` and `-torpassword` settings. To show verbose debugging information, pass `-debug=tor`.
